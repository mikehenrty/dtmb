This game is a modification of Mark Steve Samson's (`Don't touch my birdie`)[https://github.com/marksteve/dtmb]. The game's code has been modified to be more modifiable, and we have updated it to use the Phaser 3 engine, from Phaser 2. All the assets have also been replaced with more primitive versions. The intention of this is to be used as a teaching tool for video game creation.
